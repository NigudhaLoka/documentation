    %% --- FLOW DESCRIPTIONS ---
    %% The gateway forwards validated API calls to the core backend.
    Gateway -- "ForwardsAPICall" --> BackendAPI

    %% The backend API uses Firebase Auth to manage users.
    BackendAPI -- "ManagesUsers" --> FirebaseAuth

    %% When a new thread/reply is posted, the backend writes to Firestore
    %% and then enqueues a notification job in the MySQL queue.
    BackendAPI -- "WritesThread_1" --> Firestore
    BackendAPI -- "EnqueuesNotifyJob_2" --> NotificationQueue

    %% When a shareable image is requested, the backend enqueues a job.
    BackendAPI -- "EnqueuesShareableJob" --> ShareableQueue

    %% The Gateway's notification worker processes the notification queue.
    %% 1. It polls for jobs.
    %% 2. It gets the user's push token from Firestore.
    %% 3. It sends the notification via the external push service.
    GatewayWorker -- "Polls_1" --> NotificationQueue
    GatewayWorker -- "GetsToken_2" --> Firestore
    GatewayWorker -- "SendsPush_3" --> PushService

    %% The Cloud Functions worker processes the shareable image queue.
    %% 1. It polls for jobs.
    %% 2. It reads the necessary thread data from Firestore.
    %% 3. It saves the final generated image to Cloud Storage.
    CloudFunctions -- "Polls_1" --> ShareableQueue
    CloudFunctions -- "ReadsData_2" --> Firestore
    CloudFunctions -- "SavesImage_3" --> CloudStorage
